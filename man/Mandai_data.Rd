\title{Mandai data}
\format{
A list of three lists: 'trees', 'plots', and 'quadrants'. Each of
these nested lists in turn consists of five data frames, named '2011' to
'2015', representing the data from each year
\describe{
\item{plotID}{Unique identifier for each plot.}
\item{treeID}{Unique identifier for each measured woody stem.}
\item{species}{Scientific species name for the woody stem.}
\item{DBH}{Diameter of woody stem at 130 cm height from the ground.}
\item{date}{Date on which the plot was surveyed in that year.}
\item{type_forest}{Forest type of the plot--either young secondary or old growth forest. See Yee et al. (2019) for more details.}
\item{type_damage}{Whether the plot was damaged by the storm event ('Affected') or not ('Unaffected').}
\item{N}{Total Nitrogen in g per kg of topsoil (10 cm depth).}
\item{P}{Total Phosphorous in mg per kg of topsoil (10 cm depth).}
\item{K}{Extractable Potassium in mg per kg of topsoil (10 cm depth).}
\item{quadrantID}{Unique identifier for each quadrant (NE, SE, SW, NW) of each plot.}
\item{leafLitterDepth}{Depth of leaf litter measured in each quadrant of each plot in cm.}
\item{canopyCover}{Canopy closedness (\%) as measured with a spherical densiometer.}
